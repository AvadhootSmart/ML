I'll go through the code in your Jupyter notebook (`Assignment_2.ipynb`) to explain its functionality, as well as prepare some viva-style questions and answers along with relevant theory. 

Let's begin by opening and analyzing the code.

The notebook `Assignment_2.ipynb` contains several code cells that outline steps to analyze a dataset using various data processing and machine learning techniques. Below is an explanation of each cell, along with some viva-style questions, answers, and theoretical background.

---

### Cell 1: Importing Libraries
The first cell imports common Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning, including:
- **`numpy`** for numerical computations.
- **`pandas`** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **`matplotlib.pyplot`** and **`seaborn`** for data visualization.
- **`train_test_split`** from `sklearn.model_selection` for splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **`LogisticRegression`** from `sklearn.linear_model` for training a logistic regression model.
- **`accuracy_score`, `classification_report`, and `confusion_matrix`** from `sklearn.metrics` for model evaluation.

#### Viva Questions
1. **Why do we use `numpy` and `pandas` in data science?**
   - **Answer**: `numpy` is used for efficient numerical computations, especially for arrays and matrices, while `pandas` provides tools for data manipulation and handling structured data like tables.

2. **What are `train_test_split` and `LogisticRegression` used for?**
   - **Answer**: `train_test_split` divides the dataset into training and testing sets, and `LogisticRegression` is a classification algorithm used to model the probability of a categorical outcome.

### Cell 2: Loading the Dataset
This cell loads a dataset from a file named `"Social_Network_Ads.csv"` using `pandas.read_csv`.

#### Viva Questions
1. **What is `pd.read_csv()` used for?**
   - **Answer**: `pd.read_csv()` reads a CSV file and stores the data in a DataFrame, a table-like structure for data manipulation.

2. **Why is loading data the first step in data analysis?**
   - **Answer**: Loading data allows access to the dataset, enabling further steps like cleaning, analysis, and modeling.

### Cell 3: Data Overview
Here, `df.head()` and `df.info()` are used to display the first few rows and summary information about the dataset, such as column names and data types.

#### Viva Questions
1. **What is the purpose of `df.head()` and `df.info()`?**
   - **Answer**: `df.head()` displays the first five rows, providing a quick view of the data, while `df.info()` gives summary information like column data types, allowing for better understanding of the dataset.

2. **Why is understanding data types important in machine learning?**
   - **Answer**: Knowing data types helps in choosing appropriate preprocessing techniques and algorithms, as some models require specific types of input.

### Cell 4: Visualizing the Data
This cell uses `sns.scatterplot` to create a scatter plot, visualizing relationships between variables such as `Age` and `EstimatedSalary` against `Purchased`.

#### Viva Questions
1. **Why are visualizations important in data analysis?**
   - **Answer**: Visualizations reveal patterns, trends, and relationships that are not easily visible in raw data.

2. **What can we infer from a scatter plot?**
   - **Answer**: A scatter plot shows the relationship between two continuous variables, potentially indicating correlations or clusters.

---

### Cell 5: Preparing the Data
The dataset's feature columns (`Age` and `EstimatedSalary`) and target column (`Purchased`) are separated into `X` and `y` variables. The data is then split into training and test sets using `train_test_split`.

#### Viva Questions
1. **Why do we split the dataset into training and testing sets?**
   - **Answer**: Splitting ensures the model is evaluated on unseen data, allowing for an unbiased assessment of its performance.

2. **What does `test_size=0.2` indicate?**
   - **Answer**: It allocates 20% of the data to the test set and 80% to the training set.

---

### Cell 6: Model Training
A logistic regression model is instantiated and trained on the training set (`X_train`, `y_train`).

#### Viva Questions
1. **What is logistic regression, and when is it used?**
   - **Answer**: Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used for binary outcomes; it models the probability of a binary dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.

2. **How does logistic regression differ from linear regression?**
   - **Answer**: Linear regression predicts continuous values, while logistic regression predicts categorical outcomes by modeling probabilities using a sigmoid function.

---

### Cell 7: Model Prediction
This cell uses `model.predict(X_test)` to generate predictions on the test set, and the predictions are stored in `y_pred`.

#### Viva Questions
1. **What does `model.predict()` do?**
   - **Answer**: It generates predictions for the input data based on the model learned during training.

2. **Why do we store predictions in a variable like `y_pred`?**
   - **Answer**: Storing predictions allows for further evaluation and analysis, such as calculating accuracy or creating a confusion matrix.

---

### Cell 8: Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix. These metrics provide insight into how well the model performs in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### Viva Questions
1. **What is accuracy in classification?**
   - **Answer**: Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions, giving a general measure of model performance.

2. **Why is a confusion matrix useful?**
   - **Answer**: It shows the distribution of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, helping to evaluate the model's performance on each class.

3. **What is an F1-score?**
   - **Answer**: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics to provide a single measure of a modelâ€™s effectiveness, especially in imbalanced datasets.
