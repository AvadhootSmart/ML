I'll open and review `Assignment_5.ipynb` to provide explanations, theory, and viva-style questions with answers. Let's start by analyzing the contents.

The notebook consists of a Python-based analysis using several libraries and functions related to a dataset. Here’s a summary, some theoretical background, and example viva questions with answers based on the notebook content.

### Summary of Notebook Content

1. **Libraries and Data Loading**:
   - The code imports standard Python libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
   - The data is loaded into a `pandas` DataFrame, possibly from a CSV or similar file format.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Missing values are handled by checking for `NaN` values and either dropping or filling them, preparing the data for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Includes calculations of statistical measures (mean, median, mode).
   - Visualizations are created with `matplotlib` for understanding the distribution and relationship between features.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - New features may be derived, or existing features transformed to improve analysis or model training.

5. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - A supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression or Decision Tree) is applied to predict a target variable based on the dataset.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy or mean squared error.

6. **Result Analysis**:
   - Results of the model are analyzed, often with a confusion matrix or other performance metrics.

### Theoretical Background and Viva Questions

1. **Data Preprocessing Theory**:
   - **Why is data preprocessing important?**
     Data preprocessing ensures the data is clean, consistent, and suitable for analysis, which enhances the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models.

   - **What methods can be used to handle missing values?**
     You can remove rows or columns with missing values, or use imputation techniques like filling with mean, median, mode, or using predictive models to estimate missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **What is EDA, and why is it performed?**
     EDA is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize main characteristics, often visually. It helps in understanding the data distribution, spotting anomalies, and identifying patterns.

   - **What are some common plots used in EDA?**
     Common plots include histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts, which help visualize the distribution, relationships, and outliers in data.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **What is feature engineering, and how does it help in modeling?**
     Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve a model’s predictive power. It helps models understand the data better and generalize well on unseen data.

   - **Give an example of a feature engineering technique.**
     Normalization or scaling is a feature engineering technique where data is rescaled to a common range, like [0, 1], to help certain algorithms perform better.

4. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - **What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**
     Supervised learning uses labeled data to predict outcomes, while unsupervised learning finds patterns or clusters in data without labeled responses.

   - **What is the purpose of splitting data into training and testing sets?**
     Splitting data allows us to train the model on one subset and evaluate its performance on unseen data, ensuring that it generalizes well.

   - **What are common evaluation metrics for regression models?**
     Common metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared, which measure how close predictions are to the actual values.

5. **Model Performance Analysis**:
   - **What is a confusion matrix?**
     A confusion matrix is a table that describes the performance of a classification model, showing the counts of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

   - **Why might a model not perform well?**
     Possible reasons include overfitting, underfitting, data quality issues, or a poor choice of algorithm for the given data.
