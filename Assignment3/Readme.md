I'll open and review the new file you uploaded, `Assignment_3.ipynb`, to provide explanations, theory, and viva-style questions with answers. Let's start by analyzing the contents.

The notebook contains a Python script focused on machine learning, specifically on loading, exploring, and processing a dataset using the `pandas` library and potentially preparing it for predictive modeling. Here’s a breakdown of the steps in this code, some theoretical background, and related viva-style questions with answers.

### Code Explanation and Theory

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   ```
   - The `pandas` library is a popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It's particularly useful for handling structured data, as it allows for easy reading, modification, and aggregation of tabular data.

   **Viva Question**: What is `pandas` and why is it commonly used in data science?
   - **Answer**: `pandas` is a data manipulation and analysis library in Python. It provides data structures like DataFrames, which allow for efficient data wrangling, handling missing values, and data transformation, making it invaluable for preparing data for analysis and modeling.

2. **Loading the Dataset**:
   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv("world-happiness-report-2021.csv")
   ```
   - This line loads a CSV file into a `DataFrame` named `df`. A `DataFrame` is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns that can hold different types of data, similar to a table in a relational database.

   **Viva Question**: What is a `DataFrame`, and why is it useful?
   - **Answer**: A `DataFrame` is a 2D data structure provided by `pandas` where data is aligned in rows and columns. It’s useful because it allows for easy manipulation, filtering, and aggregation of structured data, making it essential for data analysis workflows.

3. **Exploring the Dataset**:
   ```python
   df.head()
   ```
   - The `.head()` function displays the first five rows of the dataset, which gives a quick look at the data’s structure and values.

   **Viva Question**: What does the `.head()` function do, and when would you use it?
   - **Answer**: The `.head()` function displays the first few rows of a DataFrame. It's useful for quickly verifying data loaded correctly and for getting an initial sense of its structure and content.

4. **Dataset Information and Summary**:
   ```python
   df.info()
   df.describe()
   ```
   - `df.info()` provides a concise summary of the dataset, including column names, data types, and counts of non-null values, which helps in understanding data completeness.
   - `df.describe()` offers statistical summaries (like mean, standard deviation) of numeric columns, giving insights into data distribution.

   **Viva Question**: Why is it important to check `df.info()` and `df.describe()` after loading data?
   - **Answer**: `df.info()` reveals data completeness and types, identifying missing data and data types for each column, while `df.describe()` provides statistical summaries, helping to understand the distribution, range, and central tendency of numeric features.

5. **Checking for Missing Values**:
   ```python
   df.isnull().sum()
   ```
   - This line checks each column for missing values, as handling missing data is crucial for data analysis and machine learning.

   **Viva Question**: How do you handle missing values in a dataset?
   - **Answer**: Handling missing values can involve removing rows or columns with excessive missing data, or filling in missing values with strategies like mean, median, mode, or using predictive models.

6. **Correlation Matrix**:
   ```python
   df.corr()
   ```
   - A correlation matrix shows the pairwise correlation between features. This helps identify relationships between variables, which can inform feature selection.

   **Viva Question**: What is a correlation matrix, and why is it useful?
   - **Answer**: A correlation matrix shows how variables relate to each other, with values from -1 (negative correlation) to +1 (positive correlation). It's useful for identifying features that might be strongly related, either to each other or to the target variable, which aids in feature selection.
